lesson-3 [state aand Event Handlers

Step 1 - uses JSX components (<ChatMessage />) props to directly render UI elements with props.
Step 2 - uses a JavaScript object/array to store/Save chat data (logic/state), not UI and
generate html elements using .map()

Event Handlers = run a function when we interact with the website.
onClick = run a function when clicked
onChange = runs a function when we change the text inside an <input>
How to Control input while its as Uncotrolled component - 
Remember this forever
No value → uncontrolled
With value → controlled


Naming conventions - 
CamelCase: `let userName = "Alex";` 
| Snake_case: `let user_name = "Alex";` 
| Kebab-case: `let user-name = "Alex"; // used in HTML/CSS, not valid JS variable` 
| PascalCase: `class UserName {}`
 

Learn to Code -
Write content code: Writing each element or line manually without loops.
Generate code: Creating elements dynamically using map() or loops.
Explanation: Manual code is simple for small data, generated code is efficient for large or dynamic data.

randomUUID:
What: randomUUID() generates a unique identifier (UUID) automatically.
Why: It is used to uniquely identify items like users, messages, or list keys.
Example: const id = crypto.randomUUID(); → gives a unique ID every time.

Array destructuring:
What: Array destructuring lets you extract values from an array into variables.
Why: It makes code cleaner and easier to read.
Example: const [a, b] = [10, 20];

Best Practice :
Do not use the DOM manually [react manages it]
Lifting State Up - means moving shared state to a common parent component.
Same names for Component , props , value {Naming Conventions}

Value prop in React:
It’s a prop (usually value) used to control a form input’s data from React state,
 making the component a controlled component.
--------------------------------------------------------------
In this lesson:

1. Save the data (using arrays and objects)
2. Generate the HTML (using .map () and key prop)
3. Make it interactive, using onclick and onChange

4. State = data that changes over time,
and is connected to the HTML

5. Updater function = update the state and update the HTML
6. Array Destructuring
7. Lifting the State Up = share state between components
8. Made <Chat Input> interactive
9. Got responses from the Chatbot
