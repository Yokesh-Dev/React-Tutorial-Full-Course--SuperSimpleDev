A-------
React Compiler is a tool that automatically optimizes React code to make apps faster.
It works by analyzing your components and automatically handling memoization,
 so React avoids unnecessary re-renders without developers writing useMemo or useCallback.
In short, you write normal React code, and the compiler improves performance behind the scenes.

B------
TypeScript is a programming language that adds types to {{our }variables in JavaScript to help catch errors early.
It works by checking your code for type mistakes during development and then compiling it 
into normal JavaScript that browsers can run.

Difference
const greet ="hello" // JS
const greet:string ="hello" //ts =>type checking Feature which is not avilable in JS

3 Best Uses of TypeScript:
Helps catch errors early by checking types before code runs.
Makes large projects easier to understand and maintain.
Improves code quality with better autocomplete and documentation.

Convert a Js code base to Ts .
