/// Ways to write  JavaScript 

Inline JS – JS inside HTML tags
Example: <button onclick="alert('Hi')">

Internal JS – JS inside <script> in same HTML
Used for small/testing projects

External JS file – JS in .js file linked to HTML
Best practice for large projects

External JS Library – Pre-written JS from CDN  (e.g., jQuery, React)
Saves time, adds features.
React comes from CDN or npm, and is added to the project as an external JavaScript library.


///Why React uses two imports: react and react-dom

react Core React library
Used to create components, use hooks, and manage state used for both  React Native and  React, Mobile App and 
and website.
Example: useState, useEffect

react-dom
Connects React to the browser DOM only for Websites 
Used to render components on a web page
Example: ReactDOM.createRoot()



///Why Babel is used
Babel is a JavaScript compiler.
 Its main job is to convert modern JavaScript or JSX into older JS that all browsers can understand.
 
JSX to JavaScript
React uses JSX (<div>Hello</div>), browsers don’t understand it directly.
Babel converts JSX → React.createElement() calls.

Modern JS to old JS
Converts ES6+ features (like let, const, arrow functions) into ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.

//Display Multiple Elements in React
In React, you cannot return multiple elements directly from a component unless they are wrapped.
Wrap in parent <div>
Use React Fragment: <React.Fragment> or <> </>

//Advantages of Using JSX - JSX = Readable + Safe + Dynamic + Easy to debug
Easy to read & write – Looks like HTML, easier than plain JS.
Faster development – Combines HTML and JS in one place.
Supports dynamic content – Can embed JS expressions with {}.
Better debugging – Errors point to specific components/lines.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In this lesson:

1. React = external library that helps us create websites easier
2. Load the React external library
3. Set up React and use .render()
4. Reviewed basics of HTML and JavaScript
5. JSX = enhanced version of JavaScript
6. Created elements directly with JSX
7. Insert values into JSX elements
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<React.StrictMode> (Short Note)

Development-only tool to catch bugs, unsafe code, and deprecated APIs.
Wrap your app:
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>

✅ Does not affect UI or production.

What is <React.StrictMode>?

It’s a tool for development only (does not affect production).

Helps find potential problems in your React app.

Why it’s used

Detects unsafe lifecycles – Shows warnings for old/unsafe React methods.

Identifies unexpected side effects – Helps catch bugs in state or effects.

Warns about deprecated APIs – Prepares your app for future React versions.

Double-invokes certain functions (like useEffect) in development to help spot bugs.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Error Boundary
React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components.

Prevents the whole app from crashing when an error occurs.

Shows a fallback UI instead of breaking the app.

Key points:

Only catches errors in render, lifecycle methods, and constructors of child components.

Cannot catch errors in event handlers.

Implemented using class components with:

static getDerivedStateFromError(error)

componentDidCatch(error, info)
