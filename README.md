<h2>💬 React Chatbot - Final Project</h2> 

📌 Project Purpose
This project was developed to practice and apply modern React concepts by building a fully interactive chatbot application.
While certain assets and setup instructions were provided by the course, I implemented the React logic and component structure myself.

🧩 Features Implemented
Interactive chatbot interface
State management for messages and user input
Dynamic message rendering
Basic styling for a clean UI
Component-based architecture for maintainability
🧠 What I Learned
Building React components with JSX
Managing state using useState
Handling events and user input in React
Conditional rendering for dynamic content

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js version 22 or higher
npm or yarn package manager
Git (for cloning the repository)
Installation
Clone the repository or extract the project files to your local machine

Navigate to the backend directory:

cd ecommerce-backend
Install backend dependencies:

npm install
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../ecommerce-project
Install frontend dependencies:

npm install
Running the Application
Start the Backend Server

From the ecommerce-backend directory:

npm run dev
The backend server will start on port 3000 (or the port specified in the PORT environment variable).

Start the Frontend Development Server

From the ecommerce-project directory:

npm run dev
The frontend application will be available at the URL provided by Vite (typically http://localhost:5173).

Production Build

To build the frontend for production:

npm run build
The production build will be generated in the dist directory.

Development
Code Quality
The project uses ESLint for code quality and consistency. Run the linter with:

npm run lint
Testing
The frontend includes Vitest for unit testing. Run tests with:

npm test
Database
The backend uses SQLite by default, with support for MySQL and PostgreSQL through Sequelize. The database schema is automatically synchronized on server startup, and default data is seeded if the database is empty.

Configuration
Environment Variables
The backend server can be configured using environment variables:

PORT - Server port (default: 3000)
Database Configuration
Database configuration can be modified in the Sequelize model files located in ecommerce-backend/models/.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Ensure Node.js version 22 or higher is installed
Delete node_modules and reinstall dependencies
Check that the backend server is running before starting the frontend
Verify database file permissions (for SQLite)
Review server console logs for error messages
For additional troubleshooting steps, refer to ecommerce-backend/troubleshooting.md.
