Lesson -7

Backend = A website may have 1000s of data , there is no sense in saving this data locally or 
in clients computer locally {there might not be enough space} .so we setup another computer / Data center ,
this saves all the data and sends data which is requested by user. This computer is called Backed.
If i add a data to site , it cant saved in clients local pc because , if the login in another pc the data in
old pc cant be accessed, so we save the data in backend.

data fetching = get data from backend (using code)

axois = cleaner way to make requests to backend

useEffect = lets us control when some code runs
[] = lets us contril when useEffect runs

query parameter = lets us add aditional info to our requests

Chromedevtools = Networktab ->Resposes to check api responses.


Backend = manage the data
Frontend = present the data

-------------------------------
In this lesson:

1. Backend = manages the data
2. Set up a backend for our project
3. Data Fetching
4. axios = easier way to make requests to the backend
5. Generate the HTML using data from the backend
6. Separated into smaller components
7. Async Await = write asynchronous code like normal code
